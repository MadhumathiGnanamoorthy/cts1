            <h2>What is Glioma?</h2>
            <p>Glioma is a type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord. It originates from glial cells, which support and protect neurons. Gliomas can be classified into several types based on their appearance, location, and how quickly they grow.</p>
            <p>Gliomas are among the most common types of brain tumors, accounting for about 30% of all brain and central nervous system tumors and 80% of all malignant brain tumors.</p>

    <section class="centered-section">
        <h2>Types of Glioma</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Astrocytoma: Tumors that arise from star-shaped glial cells known as astrocytes. They can range from low-grade, slow-growing tumors to high-grade, aggressive tumors like glioblastomas.</li>
            <li>Oligodendroglioma: These tumors develop from oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce the protective covering of nerves called myelin. They are generally slower-growing than astrocytomas.</li>
            <li>Ependymoma: Tumors that arise from ependymal cells, which line the ventricles of the brain and the center of the spinal cord. Ependymomas can occur at any age but are more common in young children.</li>
            <li>Glioblastoma: The most aggressive and common type of glioma, glioblastomas are highly malignant tumors that arise from astrocytes. They are known for their rapid growth and resistance to treatment.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="centered-section">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of glioma depend on the tumor's size, location, and rate of growth. Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Headache, particularly one that is most severe in the morning or that worsens with activity.</li>
            <li>Nausea and vomiting, often related to increased pressure in the brain.</li>
            <li>Confusion or cognitive decline, which may manifest as difficulty thinking, understanding information, or making decisions.</li>
            <li>Memory loss, particularly short-term memory.</li>
            <li>Personality changes or increased irritability, which can affect relationships and social interactions.</li>
            <li>Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision, or loss of peripheral vision.</li>
            <li>Speech difficulties, which can range from slurred speech to difficulty finding the right words.</li>
            <li>Seizures, especially in someone who has never had seizures before.</li>
        </ul>
